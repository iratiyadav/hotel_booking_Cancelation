# Hotel Booking Analysis
## Overview
This project explores a dataset containing hotel booking information, focusing on various factors affecting reservation cancellations. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

## Libraries Used
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. seaborn
4. warnings
   
## Dataset
The dataset, 'hotel_bookings.csv', consists of 119,390 entries with 32 columns, covering details such as hotel type, reservation status, lead time, and customer information.

## Data Cleaning
1. Checked for null values and handled them accordingly.
2. Converted data types, specifically converting the 'reservation_status_date' column to datetime.
   
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Explored data distribution and summary statistics.
2. Visualized reservation status count and cancellation proportions.
3. Analyzed cancellation trends in different hotel types.
4. Investigated the average daily rate (ADR) trends over time for both city and resort hotels.

## Visualizations
1. Plotted reservation status count, cancellation proportions, and ADR trends.
2. Explored the distribution of cancellations across months.
3. Investigated ADR trends for canceled and not canceled reservations.
4. Visualized the top 10 countries with the highest number of canceled reservations.
5. Explored market segment proportions and cancellation rates.
 
 ## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into reservation patterns, cancellation trends, and the impact of various factors on the hotel booking process.
